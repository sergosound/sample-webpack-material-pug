# Circular Std

> The Circular Std family is a beautiful font that is elegant and unique in it's own ways and now you can integrate it in your projects with ease.

:sparkles: Originally forked from [elartix/circular-std](https://github.com/elartix/circular-std)

# Installation

npm: `npm install circular-std`

yarn: `yarn add circular-std`

# Usage

This repo is more focused on integrating the font inside a project with a bundler like [webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack) or [parcel](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel) but you can still use it anywhere.

Include the package in your main javascript file:

```js
import "circular-std";
```

That's it! now to apply the font to any text simply apply the **CircularStd** font using css and the font will be used!

```css
h1 {
  font-family: CircularStd;
  font-weight: 400;
}
```

**you could import the package in a css file too but you would have to manually direct it to the node_modules directory relative to the css file and import any of the css files inside the dist directory**
